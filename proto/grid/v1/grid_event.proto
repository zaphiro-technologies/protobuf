Headers used in rabbitMQ (only if not sent as part of `DataSet`):
* `id` (string): id of the `Event`
* `type` (string): always `Event` - used for routing.
* `eventType` (string): the specific type of `GridEvent`, this is required in addition 
  to `type` for de-serialization of the messages.
* `sourceId` (string): the id of the source (e.g. a PMU) that generated the event.
* `timestampId` (int64): related measurement Unix msec timestamp (if any)
